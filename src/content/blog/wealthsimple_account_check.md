# 🕵️‍♂️ How to Tell If You're Paying Management Fees in Wealthsimple

Wealthsimple makes it pretty easy to invest — sometimes too easy to forget you might be paying **management fees** without realizing it. If you’re like me and have a TFSA, RRSP, non-registered account, and a chequing account all with Wealthsimple, here’s how to quickly figure out if you’re being charged a **0.4% management fee** on your investments.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check Your Homepage for Labels

When you log into your Wealthsimple app or website, head to your **Accounts** list:

- If you see a label like `Managed` next to your account (e.g., TFSA or RRSP), that means it’s a **Wealthsimple Invest** account — **they manage it, and you’re paying a fee**.
- If there’s no label and you see stock tickers like `VEQT`, `TSLA`, or `XAW`, that’s likely a **self-directed** account — no management fee here!

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Account Numbers in Settings

Go to **Settings → Accounts**, and look at the **account numbers**. The prefixes tell you what type they are:

- 📗 **Numbers starting with `H`** → Self-directed (Wealthsimple Trade)
- 📘 **Numbers starting with `W`** → Managed or registered savings accounts (Wealthsimple Invest)
- 📙 **Numbers starting with `WZ`** → Self-directed registered accounts (TFSA/RRSP via Wealthsimple Trade)

> **Example:**
>
> - `W-1234567` → Managed TFSA, you're likely paying 0.4% annually.
> - `H-2345678` → Self-directed TFSA, no management fee.
> - `WZ-9876543` → Self-directed TFSA inside Trade app, also no fee.

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Check Your Statements

You can also confirm by looking at your monthly statements:

- Go to **Settings → Documents → Statements**
- Look for terms like `Advisory Fee` or `Management Fee`

If you see these, it’s managed. If not, you’re all good!

## 🏁 Wrapping Up

If you didn’t know about these fees — you’re not alone. I didn’t either. Wealthsimple’s “set it and forget it” vibe is great, but it’s worth knowing what you’re paying for.

If you’re comfortable managing your own ETFs (like `VEQT`, `XEQT`, or `VFV`), switching to a self-directed Wealthsimple Trade account could save you hundreds a year.
